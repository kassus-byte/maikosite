			  <p>     	 The heat was unbearable for me that day, and my purple hoodie obviously didn't help. As bright as the sun, <br>
			  I couldn’t help but notice this guy’s yellow Among Us keychain when he passed us by—waving his hand to greet. I came <br>
			  to know that his name is Maiko. Cute eyes, pleasant voice, good height—“This guy is cute,” I thought to myself. We ended up <br>
			  in the same circle of friends yet barely spoke to each other. Fast forward, we got to know each other during our Founders’ <br>
			  Preparation, and he turned out to be really interesting. Since then, I knew I liked him, not just as a friend. That’s basically how I’d summarize how this birthday boy and I met. </p>
				 
				
				 
				
				
				<p>Today, September 9, a fine young gentleman is born, and we’re here to celebrate his greatness. </p>
